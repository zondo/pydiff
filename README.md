pyxldiff
========

This is a 'diff' program for Excel spreadsheets.  At the moment, there's no
actual program; you have to run it like this:

    python -m xldiff FILE1 [FILE2]

With one arg, it dumps a text representation of a single spreadsheet.  With
two, it runs a 'diff' on the text representation of both sheets.

TODO: finish this!
